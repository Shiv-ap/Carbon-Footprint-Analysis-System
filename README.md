# Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Tracking & Analysis System

## 1. Project Vision: The "Why"

In an era of increasing climate awareness, individuals lack accessible tools to quantify and understand their personal environmental impact. The goal of this project was to address this gap by engineering a data-driven solution that empowers users to track their carbon footprint, identify key contributing factors, and make informed decisions to promote sustainability. I wanted to move beyond simple calculators and build a full-fledged analytics platform to demonstrate how data can drive meaningful personal change.

## 2. Executive Summary

This project is an end-to-end data analytics system I architected and developed to provide a holistic view of an individual's carbon footprint. I engineered a data pipeline using Python to ingest and process data from diverse sources (home energy, transportation, daily activities) and store it in a structured SQLite database. The culmination of this work is a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights, featuring KPI scorecards, trend analysis, and root-cause exploration tools. This project showcases a complete cycle of data engineering, from database design and ETL to advanced business intelligence and visualization.

## 4. Key Accomplishments & Technical Skills Demonstrated

I was responsible for the entire lifecycle of this project, from conception to deployment. My key contributions were:

* **Data Pipeline Engineering:** I developed a suite of Python scripts using Pandas to automate the ingestion, cleaning, and transformation of data, ensuring it was structured and ready for analysis.
* **Relational Database Architecture:** I designed and implemented a normalized SQLite database schema from scratch. This involved defining table relationships and data types to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
* **Advanced SQL Analytics:** I authored over ten complex SQL queries to perform deep-dive analysis directly on the database, identifying trends, weekly patterns, and high-impact activities that would inform the dashboard design.
* **Business Intelligence & DAX Modeling:** I designed and built a multi-page Power BI dashboard, which involved:
    * Creating a robust data model with a dedicated calendar table.
    * Writing over a dozen complex DAX measures for KPIs, time-intelligence calculations (YoY, MTD), and performance-to-target metrics.
    * Implementing conditional formatting and interactive features like drill-downs and cross-filtering to create an intuitive user experience.

## 5. Technical Architecture

* **Backend & Data Processing:** Python 3 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Data Querying:** SQL
* **Business Intelligence & Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI (DAX, M Query)
* **Optional Integration:** A YAML configuration was developed for future extensibility with the Home Assistant smart home platform.

## 6. Project Conclusion & Impact

This project successfully demonstrates the power of a well-architected data system to solve a real-world problem. It proves my ability to handle a project from end-to-end, showcasing skills in Python programming, database management, SQL, and advanced Power BI visualization. The final dashboard is not just a report; it's a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making, empowering users to understand and reduce their environmental impact.
